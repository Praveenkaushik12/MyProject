IMMUNOGLOBULIN IgE, SERUM
(CLIA )IU/mL <378.00 1849.20
Result Rechecked,
Please Correlate Clinically.
Result Rechecked.
Note:  1. Normal levels of IgE do not rule out possibility of IgE dependent allergies as the diagnostic 
              sensitivity of the test depends upon elapsed time between exposure to an allergen and testing, 
              patient age and affected target organs.
    2. No close correlation has been demonstrated between severity of allergic reaction and IgE levels.
Comments 
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is the most important trigger molecule for allergic information. The level of IgE is 
low during the first year of life, gradually increases with age and reaches adult levels after 10 years. As 
IgE is a mediator of allergic  response, quantitative  measurement can provide  useful information for 
differential  diagnosis of  atopic and non-atopic disease. Patients with atopic diseases like Allergic 
asthma, Allergic rhinitis & Atopic dermatitis have moderately elevated IgE levels.                              
                                                                          
 Increased Levels  -  Atopic/Non-atopic allergy, Hyper IgE syndrome, Parasitic infections, IgE Myeloma, 
 Pulmonary Aspergillosis, Immunodeficiency states & Autoimmune diseases                 
Uses
·Evaluation of children with strong family history of allergies and early clinical signs of disease
·Evaluation of children and adults suspected of having allergic respiratory disease to establish the 
diagnosis and define the allergens
·To confirm clinical expression of sensitivity to foods in patients with Anaphylactic sensitivity or with 
Asthma, Angioedema or Cutaneous disease
·To evaluate sensitivity to insect venom allergens particularly as an aid in defining venom specificity in 
those cases in which skin tests are equivocal
·To confirm the presence of IgE antibodies to certain occupational allergens
